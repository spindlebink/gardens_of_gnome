# Gardens of Gnome

A chill gardening game written in 48 hours for the GMTK game jam 2022.

* Art by [Anplay​](https://itch.io/profile/annika-r-burgwall), [Me.Artzz​](https://meartzz.itch.io/), and [Captain Katt​](https://captainkatt.itch.io/).
* Systems by [Vizipokemon](https://vizipokemon.itch.io/) and myself (@spindlebink).
* Music and sound design by me using some CC0 sounds from Freesound.org.

It runs on Godot 3.4 Mono.
